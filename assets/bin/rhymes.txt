Ride tides 'round the earth like he followed the moon when its full
why lie i found white lies can hurt or be wonderfull too 
the splendor is endless I'd like to spend it with you 
33 send it to the grave unless her reign is most the way through
everyone knows bill billions my timing and brilliance both combined can 
only rivaled by zeus' with his thunder and lighning bolts
you know where i be yeah you sure i'm living at 
im at the ritz violating rules in fact   
so skilled and amazing the more rules i break the more they want me back 
after the ashes burn down to the floor, as im leaving you bastards you're begging for more
core to the center of the human advnture and whores were the first thing our species invented
or see two can take up the room fast if they aint using the mattress 
her eyes belie her fashion and tell when shes coming soon                          
Public display of love an pain will melt in the skies'till the end of my days  
And  these mentions of fame and how rare it is carelessness 
Keep me stuck this way the disparagement keeps the 
 love and the pain in an endless display  
And this will be the end of my weakness.  
those thoughts can 
define the weak type of guy the reason why is he chooses to stay that way  
But not ryan he’s hardly alive died a thousand deaths and He’s still getting by 
see my life's divine when i take the stage, bought the ticket and took the ride 
I'm stuck this way 
 somethings alive in my third eye they're attacking my brain 
 placing the old beliefs  
in the trunk of my space ship and im flying away 
 Dying to say 
 
Confusion` 
ill leave you with several contusions and your crutches rub the abrasions
and wounds till the bruises pulsing black and blue ‘till you’re fully consumed. 
Blunt force trauma to the head and a bottle of  booze  run through the crew full of losers and mutants 
And whick onre are you?  
‘cause the truth is the music and Mathematics both fused with a emtions and bad habbits.  
your inatimate imagination manifests as failed creations am I agod ofr just the son of satan. 
Initiation in ti the [ba-ben-it] is eminent soon it doesn’t matter 
Busting out the firmament 
  i'm immune to the rhetoric and pointless confusion your girl told me she  
  believes the lines full of bullshit and stupid solutions that'll never let you get ahead of it 
the usual suspects are'nt always the ones using some fuses as shoestrings 
All this weight on my shoulders has got me Sweating profusely  
    I Come over showing you lessons to keep awakening this journalistic anguish
filled out on every page of my loose leaf So open your eyes and them in to let the truth speak 
youd think i was writing a movie the way my rhymes move you in ways
more entertaining  than the lame vivid dreams of the life that you seek 

cant complain with that schooling you had
  gimme two weeks to learn it you said but id rather nap instead billions is up on top stepping all you  
fools for confusingthe rantings and the sentiment.  
I grab my pen When we try to keep evil defenceless
i leverage The deamons using leads  
That I freeed from the evident breath whats heard will be wise and see it for what it is
this is what divides the shepherd from the sheep 
Pressed for Eternal time, we press on a dime and arrive moving 
nowhere when we stepping over these lines we brighter
than you can prepare prepair try not to stop we moving alive when the high tides come in. 
The skys vibes a raising as we radiate the light within. 
Here to take my life back I trried once and ill try angan 

     you clowns keep on raiding the lockers, 
imma slaughter her and fuck her daughter till she's 
walking around my house wearing my  underwear 
blissuflly unaware and wondering where she
can check for me supposely sentimentally. 
i see you wandering behind as we hop in the ride
and imma tear out of here take a drive or a fly  we right at the mariran 
sky i know you love a good scandal so come close and didnt notice my hand grab the handle 
nice and quick like a commando around kick her out and say bye.  
then i come back rich with a 
tarp and a stick cuz im using it inside to hold up the rits and go 
back years later maybe in november reliving  a 
needless time when im watching tv and a guy on pbs named bill nye,
im getting high with him at the ritz,
and hes blowing my mind while shes blowing these guys
no woories about girlys and such its B-Killions  
i got billions of sperm in my nuts. 
litterally, come fuck me, I need more drugs 
so round up the kids like you give a fuck 
figureatively cuz girl you know youre a slut.
  
meet me in utah at the church, on the back of your block.  
ill bust on your back, FACE and THIRD In your BUTT. 
Thats true Fuck you its something great to spoil. you can tell by 
the way im spillin ink on this plate. 
toiling over the lines throughout infiniate
 lives i believe these pointless endevors i like are recently to  its fn for me recenly i decided tring take my time  
IVE BEEN JESUS AND   
and runnning the humand race leanring form a 4th perspective and i 
gotta lead the her and leave the heard  
when you heard and leave you with those contusu=ions i was
tyaloking aout in the last verse im be deadcurisin round in my underwae anaware, 
of any worries, foot on the gas and time to spare, I light a flare to the sky like 
im the only one left I cant bare another second on the edge, time to step, my lifes
only fueled by the overwhelming regret, that fills my soul every time I allow myself to forget.
